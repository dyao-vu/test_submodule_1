but both retrieve the results only if word1 and word2 are on the same line, and the second one does not retrieve if 
word2 comes first in the line, which is something that I don't want.

I want to retrieve the files, even if the two words are not on same line (I am not sure how many lines separates them, and the order is not important; any order should be fetched).

Is this possible ?
